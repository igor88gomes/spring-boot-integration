# Security Policy

This is a demo/portfolio repository. It is not intended for production use, but
we still welcome responsible disclosure of security issues.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest `main` branch is maintained on a best-effort basis.

| Version/Branch | Supported |
|----------------|-----------|
| `main`         | ✅        |
| others         | ❌        |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not open public issues** for security reports.

- Use **GitHub Security Advisories** (preferred): “Security → Report a vulnerability”
- Or email: igor88gomes@gmail.com

We’ll acknowledge best-effort within **7 days** and keep you updated as we
triage and address the report.

## Disclosure

We follow coordinated disclosure. We may request time to validate and prepare a
fix before any public disclosure. Credit is given on request.

## Out of Scope (for this demo)

- Denial-of-service and volumetric attacks
- Findings that require privileged/local access
- CVEs only present in example/dev dependencies without a practical exploit path
- Issues in third-party services outside this repository
