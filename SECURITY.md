# Security Policy

This repository is a **demo/portfolio project**.  
It demonstrates integration of basic **DevSecOps practices** such as dependency scanning,
image vulnerability scanning, and secret scanning.

⚠️ **Note:** Findings from these scanners are shown **for demonstration purposes only**  
and are **not actively reviewed or fixed**.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest `main` branch is maintained on a best-effort basis.

| Version/Branch | Supported |
|----------------|-----------|
| `main`         | ✅        |
| others         | ❌        |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not open public issues** for security concerns.

If you want to practice responsible disclosure, you may use:

- **GitHub Security Advisories** (preferred):  
  Use the “Report a vulnerability” button under the **Security** tab.  
  This sends a private report directly to the maintainer (me).
- Or email: igor88gomes@gmail.com

All reports are handled on a **best-effort basis**, since this is a demo project.
